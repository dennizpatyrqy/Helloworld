First Battle with HTML.

HTML

I was confused on where to start from that evening i stared at my system for over 10mins and wondered how i was going to start. Took me sometime to get familiar with VScode, my code was in plain text didn't know i was to choose the language. down the line i told myself to take the bull by the horn "difficult task Ahead"

finally the code was falling in place after so much mistakes and nagging. below are images of the code and output.

BOTTOM LINE

I DID NOT SETTLE I KEPT PUSHING.
